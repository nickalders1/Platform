### Rule gate
The Rule gate eliminates the "I didnt know the rules" discussion once and for all.

Set a trial period during which players can play on your servers before they are required to accept the rules. During the trial they are reminded to visit the Community website and accept the rules.

When the trial expires the player receives a final reminder and is kicked when they fail to comply.

#### Rule page example
After configuring which page contains the rules GSA will automatically add a button to the page so people can accept the rules.
